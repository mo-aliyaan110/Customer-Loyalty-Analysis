In this Insurance Analytics project, I took the data from different websites and datasets and merged them together using numpy and pandas library of Python to form a total of 23 variables and 1 lakh records.
Handled missing values, special symbols, anomalies, and duplicate values.
Handled the non-numeric data and converted them to numeric by performing encoding by using the ScikitLearn (Sklearn) library of Python.
Converted the different units of data such as income in rupees, age in years etc, to a single unit by performing scaling on data by using the Scikitlearn library of Python.
Visualized the data to analyze the distribution of the overall data, the relation between the variables, and variation in the data, and calculated the measures of central tendency such as mean, median, and mode by using the Matplotlib and SeaBorn library of Python.
Used the Naive-Bayes Machine Learning algorithm as the base model and noted the performance of the model using different performance metrics from the ScikitLearn library.# Customer-Loyalty-Analysis
